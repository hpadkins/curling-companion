### what we have done:

* we have a page created with radio buttons.
* when a radio button is selected, it stores the value associated with the selection into this.state.
* we have a non-functional button for the next screen.

### what we have planned next:

* next we would like to merge in the work done by ernesto and jiaqi into our branch, and set the button they created to point to our new page.
* We also need to fix the "next" button in our screen so that users can proceed to the (not yet begun) game-tracking screen. Until that screen is completed, our next button will simply go * return the user to the homescreen.
